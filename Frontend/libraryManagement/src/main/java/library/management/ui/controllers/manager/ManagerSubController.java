 * The ManagerSubController serves as an abstract base class for controllers

 * centralized {@link MainController}.
 *
 * This class provides a basic structure and functionality for sub-controllers,
 * including access to the main controller. It allows derived classes to focus
 * on implementing task-specific behaviors while maintaining a consistent interface
 * for communication with the main controller.
